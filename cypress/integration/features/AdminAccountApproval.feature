Feature: Admin Accounts Approval

              As an admin user of the Endabank,
              I want to be able to approve or disapprove an account,
     So that only allowed users will be able to sign into the application

        Scenario Outline: <status> an account under admin approval
            Given the user is logged in as an '<userType>' user
              And the user is on the Admin Panel section
             When the user toggles to '<status>' an account under review


        Examples:
                  | userType | status     | accountStatus |
                  | Admin    | Deactivate | Deactivated   |
                  | Admin    | Activate   | Activated     |

        Scenario Outline: The Admin user should see the users table with the proper columns order
            Given the user is logged in as an '<userType>' user
             When the user is on the Admin Panel section
             Then the user should see the user table columns with the following order
                  | Titles     |
                  | First Name |
                  | Last Name  |
                  | Email      |
                  | Approve    |
        Examples:
                  | userType |
                  | Admin    |

        Scenario Outline: Non-admin user can't see the user approval section
            Given the user is logged in as an '<userType>' user
             Then the user tries to enter in the approval section
              And tries to enter trough the url '<url>' its redirected to home

        Examples:
                  | userType   | url                                                   |
                  | NormalUser | http://medellin-med.uc.r.appspot.com/activate-account |
